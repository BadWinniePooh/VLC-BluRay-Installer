# VLC-BluRay-Installer
This little tool copys the necessary files needed for BluRay Support into the right directories.
I created this tool out of boredom.
There are two versions at the moment, one is the Console Application and one is the Windows Forms Variant.

If you want to use this tool just download the Folder ...Release.
If you want to contribute in any way, just change stuff in ...Code.

Thank you for your attention and have a nice day!
